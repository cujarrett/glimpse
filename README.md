[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cujarrett/glimpse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cujarrett/glimpse)
## What's it do?
![demo](./media/demo.gif)
It's a React JS web app to show GitHub user metrics on beautiful graphs using Uber's awesome
[React VIS](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/blob/master/README.md) library.

## Developer Setup & Use
Setup and use requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
[Node JS (8.X.X or later)](https://nodejs.org/en/), and a text editor such as
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you're on a Mac, I'd suggest using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing the required
software listed in Setup.
